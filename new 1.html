  <h1 style="color:BLUE;"> WHY SMALL HABITS  MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE</h1>
  </body>
  </html>
  <P>
It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and<br>
underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.<hr> Too<br>
often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.<br>
Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a<br>
championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to<br>
<p style="color:red;">
make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.<br>
Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it<br>
isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long<br>
run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding</p>
<hr>.<br>
Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one<br>
year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done.<br>
Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline<br>
nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates<br>
into something much more.<br>

1% BETTER EVERY DAY<br>
1% worse every day for one year. 0.99<br>
365 = 00.03<btr>
1% better every day for one year. 1.01<br>
365 = 37.
